## Why and how?

Send To Device allows you to send text from your own different devices, you just need to login with your Google account on your different machines, it registers a Service Worker to handle incoming notifications on each browser. also you can disable notification on each browser by the top right notification toggle control.

To test it just open it and register as a user, then open another browser and login again with the same Google account, now you can send your messages through them, when you send a text all the logged in browsers gets notification.
